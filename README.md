## PlantCare
This repository houses a desktop app for plant owners who want to take extra attention of their plants.

This project is made enteirly in Java and uses JavaFX for the GUI.
I made this app for to main reasons:
 - I wanted to practice visual programming and get better with my Java skills.
 - I couldn't find any app that suited my needs.

 - Create reminders for pouring water, change soil, and more.
